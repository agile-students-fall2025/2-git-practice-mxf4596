# [What is computer vision?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/computer-vision)

I have recently been learning a lot more about computer vision and the general topic of it is really interesting to me. Its connection with deep learning and AI is also really interesting to me. Computer vision can be used for so much. Self driving cars, generative AI, and so much more can all be advanced by computer vision. This article is really good for someone getting into it. It goes over the basics like how it works and the history of it. I think it is a really great resource.

This is a thorough overview of computer vision, clearly explaining how it enables machines to see and interpret visual data using AI, deep learning, and CNNs. I appreciate how it draws parallels with human vision to make the concept intuitive. Overall, itâ€™s a well rounded explanation for both technical and non-technical readers.
